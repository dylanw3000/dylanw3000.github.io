WotC,

I have been influenced by your products for almost the entirety of my life.  The fact I played D&D when I was five years old has almost no direct relevance to my decision to become a computer programmer, but it certainly influenced the people I associated with, and developed my critical thinking skills.

I have been programming since I was young, beginning as early as age seven when I was able to construct and program a Lego robot.  This cascaded through high school with more advanced robotics, internships at companies including Autodesk, and became my college major.

My undergrad Computer Science degree was in Applied CS at Oregon State University, with an application toward simulation and game programming.  As of now, I am pursuing a Master's degree at DigiPen Institure of Technology to further hone my interests.

I have had multiple years of experience working on teams of various sizes, involving rules from people ops to pure programmer to programming lead.  I am proud of what I have accomplished, and wish to continue it at Wizards of the Coast.

Sincerely,
Dylan Washburne
